# CompressionAlgorithms

This repository is a means of organizing and demonstrating Cody Lee's student research project detailing the strengths and differences between various text-data oriented compression algorithms.

**Algorithms:**
Huffman Coding
Adaptive Huffman Coding
Shannon-Fano Coding
Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW)

Project  Breakdown:
The research in this project is broken down into three main categories:
Documentation, Implementation, and Comparison

In Documentation, the algoirthms chosen for research are explained in words and psuedo code.
In Implementation, the algorithms are implemented in C++ code and compiled in an executable format.
In Comparison, the performance metrics of the algorithms are analyzed and compared across a spectrum of use cases.
